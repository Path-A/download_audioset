This repository makes it really easy to download [Audioset](https://research.google.com/audioset/), the opensource library released by google for speech object detection research.

From Google:

    AudioSet consists of an expanding ontology of 632 audio event classes and a collection of 2,084,320 human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos. The ontology is specified as a hierarchical graph of event categories, covering a wide range of human and animal sounds, musical instruments and genres, and common everyday environmental sounds.

    By releasing AudioSet, we hope to provide a common, realistic-scale evaluation task for audio event detection, as well as a    starting point for a comprehensive vocabulary of sound events.
